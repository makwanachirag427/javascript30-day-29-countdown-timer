# JavaScript30 - Day 29

This is the README file for Day 29 of the JavaScript30 challenge, created by Wes Bos. The JavaScript30 challenge is a 30-day coding challenge that covers various aspects of JavaScript, including building projects and improving skills.

## Project Description

Day 29 focuses on creating a countdown timer with the ability to set custom time intervals. The countdown timer will have a customizable end time, allowing the user to set a specific time for the timer to count down to.

## Project Structure

The project for Day 29 includes the following files:

- `index.html`: The HTML file that contains the structure of the countdown timer interface.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for the countdown timer.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that provides styles for the countdown timer interface.

## How to Run the Project

To run the project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The countdown timer interface will be displayed, and you can set the timer to your desired time interval.

## Key Features

- Countdown timer: Display a countdown timer that counts down from a set time to zero.
- Customizable end time: Allow the user to set a specific time for the timer to count down to.
- Display of remaining time: Display the remaining time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Interface for setting time: Provide an interface for the user to set the timer to a custom time interval.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the input fields to set the desired time for the countdown timer.
3. Click the "Start" button to begin the countdown.
4. The timer will count down to zero, displaying the remaining time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
